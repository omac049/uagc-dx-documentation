# SEO Strategy & Optimization Guide

A comprehensive guide to modern SEO practices for 2025, focusing on user-first strategies that work across evolving search landscapes.

## The Evolution of Search in 2025

Search engines have transformed beyond simple keyword matching into sophisticated AI systems that understand context, intent, and user needs across multiple platforms.

### Understanding Modern Search Behavior

**Key Changes:**
- **Answer Engines**: Search engines now provide direct answers through AI Overviews and featured snippets

- **Intent-Based Results**: Search engines better distinguish between research, navigation, and purchase intent

**Strategic Implications:**
- Content must be optimized for multiple discovery platforms
- Focus on building brand authority through comprehensive topic coverage
- Optimize for both click-through traffic and brand visibility in AI summaries
- Create content that serves users at different stages of their journey

:::tip Modern Search Reality
With 90.15% market share, Google still dominates, but successful SEO now requires visibility across YouTube (2nd largest search engine), TikTok, Amazon, and emerging AI platforms like Perplexity and ChatGPT.

2. **Cluster Content**: Develop supporting pages for specific subtopics
   - "Social Media Marketing for Universities"
   - "Email Marketing Best Practices for Student Recruitment"

3. **Internal Linking Strategy**: Connect related content with contextual links
   - Use descriptive anchor text that indicates topic relevance
