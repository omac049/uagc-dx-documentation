# UI/UX Best Practices & Design Consistency

Comprehensive guide to user interface and user experience best practices for UAGC digital properties, focused on design consistency, usability, and inclusive digital experiences.

## Design Consistency Framework

### What is Design Consistency?

Design consistency is what ties UI elements together with distinguishable and predictable actions, creating a unified experience across all digital touchpoints. As outlined in the [UXPin Design Consistency Guide](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/guide-design-consistency-best-practices-ui-ux-designers/), consistency serves as a commitment to users that similar elements will behave similarly throughout the experience.

**UAGC Design Philosophy:**
> "Consistent design builds trust with prospective students and creates an intuitive pathway to educational opportunities."

### The Four Types of Design Consistency
