# Security Policy

## 🔒 Security Measures Implemented

### Search Feature Security
Our enhanced search functionality includes several security measures to prevent common vulnerabilities:

#### XSS Prevention
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized to remove potentially dangerous characters
- **HTML Escaping**: Search queries and suggestions are properly escaped before rendering
- **Character Filtering**: Removal of `<>\"'`, `javascript:` protocols, and event handlers
- **Length Limiting**: Search inputs are limited to 100 characters to prevent buffer overflow attacks

#### Input Validation
- **Type Checking**: Validation that inputs are strings before processing
- **Content Filtering**: Removal of script injection patterns and event handlers
- **Safe Storage**: LocalStorage operations are wrapped in try-catch blocks

#### DOM Security
- **Safe DOM Manipulation**: Using `textContent` instead of `innerHTML` where possible
- **Escape Functions**: Custom escape functions to prevent HTML injection
- **Sanitized Rendering**: All dynamic content is sanitized before DOM insertion

## ⚠️ Known Development Dependencies

### webpack-dev-server Vulnerability (Moderate)
- **Status**: Known issue with Docusaurus framework
- **Severity**: Moderate (Development only)
- **Impact**: Development environment only - does not affect production builds
- **Risk Level**: Low - Only affects local development servers
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Vulnerability only affects development environment
  - Production builds use static files with no webpack-dev-server
  - Updated to latest Docusaurus version (3.8.1)
  - Audit level set to "high" to filter development-only issues

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update npm packages
2. **Validate Inputs**: Always sanitize and validate user inputs
3. **Use HTTPS**: Ensure all external resources use HTTPS
4. **Content Security Policy**: Implement CSP headers in production
5. **Regular Audits**: Run `npm audit` regularly and address high/critical issues

### For Users
1. **Browser Security**: Keep browsers updated
2. **HTTPS Access**: Always access the documentation via HTTPS
3. **Report Issues**: Report any suspected security issues to the development team
