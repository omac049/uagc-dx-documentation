# Asana

This guide explains how to use Asana for managing DX tasks and projects.

## Choosing a Template

We use specific templates in Asana to standardize our workflow. Select the appropriate template when creating a new task:

- **Page Update** - For changes to existing pages
- **Delete/Redirect** - For removing pages or setting up redirects
- **New Feature** - For adding new functionality
- **Bug** - For fixing issues
- **Documentation** - For updating this documentation

## Filling Out the Basics

Every task should include these essential fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Title | Clear description of what needs to be done |
| URL(s) | Affected page(s) |
| What-success-looks-like | Expected outcome |
| Priority | Urgency level |
| Due date | When it needs to be completed |

## Auto-assignment

Asana rules automatically:
- Drop the task into the right board column
- Ping Thomas/Brandy for triage

## Task Flow

Tasks move through the following stages:

1. **Backlog** - Tasks waiting to be worked on
2. **In Progress** - Currently being worked on
3. **Peer Review** - Ready for team review
4. **Staging QA** - Ready for quality assurance
5. **Done** - Task complete and ready for deployment

When a task is deployed, a deploy note is posted in the #groupchat channel.

## Asana Best Practices

- Keep task descriptions concise but complete
- Include all relevant URLs and assets
- Tag appropriate team members
- Update status regularly
