# Understanding the UAGC Digital Experience & Enrollment Funnel

This document provides an overview of the UAGC Digital Experience (DX) and explains how it connects to the student enrollment funnel.

## What is the Digital Experience?

The UAGC Digital Experience encompasses all digital touchpoints that prospective and current students encounter during their journey with the University of Arizona Global Campus, including:

- The main UAGC website (uagc.edu)
- Program and degree pages
- Application and enrollment forms
- Student portal and learning management system
- Email communications and digital marketing
- Social media presence

These digital touchpoints work together to create a cohesive experience that guides users through the enrollment process and supports them throughout their academic journey.

## The Enrollment Funnel

The enrollment funnel represents the journey prospective students take from initial awareness to becoming enrolled students. Understanding this funnel is critical for optimizing our digital properties.

### Funnel Stages

3. **Consideration**

   - Goal: Address questions and concerns, provide decision-making information

4. **Application**

## Key Metrics and KPIs

Each stage of the enrollment funnel has specific metrics we track to measure performance:
