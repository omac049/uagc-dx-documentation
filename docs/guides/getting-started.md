# Getting Started with Documentation

This guide explains how to access, use, and contribute to the DX documentation platform.

!!! info "Before You Begin"
    Make sure you have access to Asana and the DX documentation repository before proceeding. Contact Brandy if you need access.

## Accessing the Documentation

1. Navigate to the documentation URL: [UAGC DX Documentation](https://docs.dx.uagc.edu)
2. Log in with your UAGC credentials (if required)
3. Use the navigation menu to find the documentation you need

!!! tip "Pro Tip"
    Use the search feature (<kbd>/</kbd> key) to quickly find what you're looking for!

## Using Templates

When creating new documentation:

1. Review existing documentation for style and structure
2. Choose the appropriate template for your documentation type
3. Follow the template structure to ensure consistency

!!! example "Example Template Usage"
    ```markdown
    # Document Title
    
    ## Purpose
    Explain what this document is for.
    
    ## Process
    1. Step one
    2. Step two
    3. Step three
    
    ## Related Resources
    - [Link to related document]
    ```

## Opening a Documentation Request

When documentation needs to be created or updated:

1. Log in to Asana
2. Create a new task using the **Documentation** template
3. Fill in the required information:
   - Title: Clear description of the documentation needed
   - Priority
   - Documentation area/section
   - Due date
4. Assign the task to the appropriate owner
5. Provide any additional context or requirements

!!! warning "Important"
    All documentation changes should be tracked in Asana to maintain version control and accountability.

## Documentation Best Practices

- **Be concise**: Focus on clear instructions rather than lengthy explanations
- **Use visuals**: Include screenshots or diagrams when helpful
- **Link related docs**: Connect related pieces of documentation
- **Keep it updated**: Review and update docs as processes change
- **Standardize format**: Follow established formatting guidelines

!!! note "Quarterly Reviews"
    Remember that each section owner should review their documentation quarterly as part of our "Docs Day" initiative.
