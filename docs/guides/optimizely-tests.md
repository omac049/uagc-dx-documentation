# Optimizely Tests

This guide explains the process for creating and managing A/B tests using Optimizely.

## Test Creation Process

The complete workflow from strategy to results:

1. **Strategy Brief** - Document test hypothesis and goals
2. **Asana Ticket** - Create task using experiment template
3. **Build** - Anthony creates the test variation
4. **Track** - Omar sets up event tracking
5. **QA** - Brian verifies functionality across devices
6. **Launch** - Start the experiment after approval

## Creating a Test Brief

Every experiment should start with a clear brief that includes:

- **Hypothesis** - What we believe will improve performance
- **Success Metrics** - How we'll measure improvement
- **Target Pages** - Where the experiment will run
- **Audience** - Who will see the experiment
- **Variations** - What changes we're testing

## Implementation Guidelines

When building Optimizely tests:

- Use clean, reusable code
- Follow responsive design principles
- Keep variations focused on testing specific elements
- Maintain brand guidelines in all variations
- Consider load speed impact

## QA Checklist

Before launching any test:

- Verify variation appears correctly on all target pages
- Test on multiple devices and browsers
- Confirm tracking events fire correctly
- Check for any JavaScript errors or conflicts
- Validate content for typos and accuracy

## Analyzing Results

After a test has run:

- Wait for statistical significance
- Document results in the experiment log
- Present findings to the team
- Implement winning variations as permanent changes
- Use insights to inform future test ideas
